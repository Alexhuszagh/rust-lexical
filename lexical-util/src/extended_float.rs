//! Extended precision floating-point type.
//!
//! Also contains helpers to convert to and from native rust floats.
//! This representation stores the mantissa as a 64-bit unsigned integer,
//! and the exponent as a 32-bit unsigned integer, allowed ~80 bits of
//! precision (only 16 bits of the 32-bit integer are used, u32 is used
//! for performance). Since there is no storage for the sign bit,
//! this only works for positive floats.
