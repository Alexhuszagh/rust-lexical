# FEATURES
# --------
# In order to improve compile times, we have separate support
# for each numeric conversion. Since these features are additive,
# if more features are added, separate crates can add support
# for more features without requiring re-compilation of lexical.

[features]

# Add support for numerical conversions with power-of-two strings.
power-of-two = []
# Add support for numerical conversions with non-decimal strings.

# Add support for writing integers.

# -----------
# Currently unsupported features.
# Enable support for 128-bit floats. Unsupported and unlikely to ever be.
