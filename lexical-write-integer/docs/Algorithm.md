# Algorithm Approach

Our base algorithms use binary searches with exact digit writing ([Jeaiii Algorithm](https://jk-jeon.github.io/posts/2022/02/jeaiii-algorithm/)) or using tables to write 2 digits at a time (popularized by Andrei Alexandrescu`).

## jeaiii

James Anhalt's itoa algorithm along with Junekey Jeon's performance tweaks have excellent performance, however, this can be further optimized. Both James Anhalt's and Junekey Jeon's use a binary search for determining the correct number of digits to print (for 32-bit integers).

```text
     /\____________
    /  \______     \______
   /\   \     \     \     \
  0  1  /\    /\    /\    /\
       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
```

This leads to a max tree depth of 4, and the major performance bottleneck with larger type sizes is the branching. A minor modification can optimize this, leadingg to a max tree depth of 3 while only required 1 extra comparison at the top level. Also, we invert the comparisons: oddly enough, our benchmarks show doing larger comparisons then smaller improves performance for numbers with both large and small numbers of digits.

```text
          ____________________
      ___/_       __|__       \
     /  |  \     /     \      /\
    /\  1   0   /\     /\    8  9
   3  2        6  7   4  5
```

## Digit Counting

Fast digit counting can remove the requirement to use intermediate buffers when writing digits, since the digits are written in reverse order, which can lead to dramatic performance improvements.

For values <= `u32`, we can use a fast digit counting algorithm described [here](https://lemire.me/blog/2021/06/03/computing-the-number-of-digits-of-an-integer-even-faster/).

This depends on a fast log2 algorithm, which can then be used to compare to a pre-computed table to determine to round-up or down. Note that although all the algorithms are done for `u32`, in the actual implementation they use generic values.

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn fast_log2(x: u32) -> usize {
    32 - 1 - (x | 1).leading_zeros() as usize
}

#[inline]
pub fn fast_digit_count(x: u32) -> usize {
    const TABLE: [u64; 32] = [...];
    let shift = TABLE[fast_log2(x)];
    let count = (x as u64 + shift) >> 32;
    count as usize
}
```

However, this scales poorly for larger values, just due to the static storage required. Therefore, for `u64` and larger integers, we use the slightly slower, but still fast approximation via an integral log10.

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn fast_log10(x: u32) -> usize {
    let log2 = fast_log2(x);
    (log2 * 1233) >> 12
}

pub fn fallback_digit_count(x: u32) -> usize {
    const TABLE: [u128; 38] = [...];

    let log10 = fast_log10(x);
    let shift_up = log10 < TABLE.len() && x as u128 >= TABLE[log10];
    log10 + shift_up as usize + 1
}
```

The second algorithm is trivial to explain: we calculate a fast, integral log 10 of the value, which can be off by as much as 1, rounded down. We then therefore have a pre-computed table of all values, as 128-bit integers, and then determine if the value is smaller than the desired value.

For radices with powers-of-two, we can use `log2(x) + 1` to calculate the number of digits required, which can be calculated by the leading digits.

```rust
pub fn log2(x: u32) -> usize {
    32 - (x | 1).leading_zeros() as usize
}
```

For radices of `2^N` (where `N âˆˆ [1, 5]`), we can then implement it as:

```rust
pub fn digits_pow2(x: u32, n: u32) -> usize {
    log2(x) / n + 1
}
```

Since `N` will be known at compile time, this has heavily optimized digit calculation so we do not need to shift the digits into place after writing.

## Power-of-4 Reduction

The fastest algorithm by far seems to be a power-of-4 reduction, using a loop. This reduces the number of operations to 2 division/remainder operations per loop.

The algorithm writes backwards, to the end of a buffer, and then copies everything to start of the buffer, as expected.

```rust
let radix2 = radix * radix;
let radix4 = radix2 * radix2;
while value >= radix4 {
    let r = value % radix4;
    value /= radix4;
    let r1 = (2 * (r / radix2));
    let r2 = (2 * (r % radix2));

    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r2 + 1];
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r2];
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r1 + 1];
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r1];
}

while value >= radix2 {
    let r = 2 * (value % radix2);
    value /= radix2;
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r + 1];
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r];
}

if value < radix {
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = value - b'0';
} else {
    let r = 2 * value;
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r + 1];
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = table[r];
}
```

The major performance bottleneck, however, is the intermediate copy, which can slow down the algorithm by ~3x. The solution, of course, is to pre-compute the number of digits and therefore use no intermediate buffer.

## Manually Unrolling

Another approach is to calculate the number of digits, and then to manually unroll the loops for a range of values at the cost of code size. Unfortunately, this isn't very fast in practice, even if it seems good on paper.

For example, we can unroll loops as follows:

```rust
/// Convert a value from `[100, 1000)` into a table offset.
#[inline]
fn sequential_index(v0: u32, v1: u32) -> usize {
    (2 * v0 - 200 * v1) as usize
}

/// Convert a value from `[10, 100)` into a table offset.
#[inline]
fn last_index(value: u32) -> usize {
    2 * value as usize
}

#[inline]
fn write_5(value: u32, buffer: &mut [u8]) {
    let v_0 = value;
    let v_1 = v_0 / 100;
    let v_2 = v_1 / 100;
    let i_0 = sequential_index(v_0, v_1);
    let i_1 = sequential_index(v_1, v_2);
    let i_2 = last_index(v_2);
    buffer[4] = table[i_0 + 1];
    buffer[3] = table[i_0];
    buffer[2] = table[i_1 + 1];
    buffer[1] = table[i_1];
    buffer[0] = table[i_2 + 1];
}
```

This uses the fact that we know we have **exactly** 5 digits to remove any nested branching. However, this scales poorly for larger values, since we cannot enumerate every single possibility without prohibitive code bloat. For example, we must provide all values from 6-10 digits as if by 10 digits:

```rust
#[inline]
fn write_10(value: u64, buffer: &mut [u8]) {
    let t0 = (value / 100000000) as u32;
    let v_0 = (value as u32).wrapping_sub(t0.wrapping_mul(100000000));
    let v_1 = v_0 / 100;
    let v_2 = v_1 / 100;
    let v_3 = v_2 / 100;
    let v_4 = t0;
    let i_0 = sequential_index(v_0, v_1);
    let i_1 = sequential_index(v_1, v_2);
    let i_2 = sequential_index(v_2, v_3);
    let i_3 = last_index(v_3);
    let i_4 = last_index(v_4);

    buffer[9] = table[i_0 + 1];
    buffer[8] = table[i_0];
    buffer[7] = table[i_1 + 1];
    buffer[6] = table[i_1];
    buffer[5] = table[i_2 + 1];
    buffer[4] = table[i_2];
    buffer[3] = table[i_3 + 1];
    buffer[2] = table[i_3];
    buffer[1] = table[i_4 + 1];
    buffer[0] = table[i_4];
}

fn write_5_10(value: u64, buffer: &mut [u8]) {
    let mut digits: [u8; 16] = [b'0'; 16];
    write_10(value as u64, &mut digits);
    let count = fallback_digit_count(value);
    copy_to_dst(buffer, digits.get_unchecked(10 - count..10));
}
```

This removes any performance benefits of the removed branching, and makes it considerably slower than the simpler approach.

## 128-Bit Division

128-bit division is a fundamentally slow part of integer formatting. We therefore pre-computed divisors for 128-bit division, choosing the largest radix power that fits inside a `u64`. Once we have this divisor, we can perform fast division using 1 of 4 different strategies:

1. Division by a power-of-two.

For radixes that are powers-of-two, we can do fast division as if by a bitshift and bitmask. The number of digits processed is just `digits = 64 / log2(radix)`, and `shr = log2(radix) * digits`. The mask therefore is just `(1 << shr) - 1`.

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn u128_divrem(n: u128, mask: u64, shr: u32) -> (u128, u64) {
    let quot = n >> shr;
    let rem = mask & n as u64;
    (quot, rem)
}
```

2. Fast 128-bit division via bitshifts.

Some divisors are divisible by powers-of-two, for example, `10^19` is divisible by `2^19`. In this case, if the value is less than `2^(64 + 19)`, we can use native, 64-bit division by doing:

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn u128_divrem(n: u128) -> (u128, u64) {
    let div = 10000000000000000000u64;
    let quot = (n >> 19) as u64 / (d >> 19);
    let quot = quote as u128;
    let rem = (n - quot * d as u128) as u64;
    (quot, rem)
}
```

3. Fast 128-bit division as if by multiplication.

An extended description on how to calculate these constants and the overall algorithm is found in  "Division by Invariant Integers Using Multiplication", by T. Granlund and P. Montgomery, in "Proc. of the SIGPLAN94 Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation", available online [here](https://gmplib.org/~tege/divcnst-pldi94.pdf).

In this case, we simulate division by doing a 128-bit multiplication, grabbing only the high 128-bits, and then calculating the remainder similarly.

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn u128_divrem(n: u128) -> (u128, u64) {
    let div = 10000000000000000000u64;
    let factor = 156927543384667019095894735580191660403u128;
    let quot = mulhi::<u128, u64>(n, factor) >> 62;
    let rem = (n - quot * d as u128) as u64;
    (quot, rem)
}
```

Strategies 2. and 3. are generally combined into a single function, allowing a fast approximation with a decent fallback algorithm.

4. Combined, generalized 128-bit divrem.

Approach 3. only works if `factor` can be represented in 128 bits, which is not true for all values. In the fallback case, we have to rely on true, 128-bit division. Rust, however, for `divrem` calls both division and remainder separately, requiring two, separate calls to `__udivmodti4`. We therefore just combine them into a single call.

## Compact

For our compact implementation, prioritizing code size at the cost of performance, we use a naive algorithm that writes 1 digit at a time, without any additional optimizations. This algorithm is trivial to verify, and is effectively analogous to the following code:

```rust
let mut index = buffer.len();
while value >= radix {
    let r = value % radix;
    value /= radix;
    index -= 1;
    buffer[index] = digit_to_char(r);
}

let r = value % radix;
index -= 1;
buffer[index] = digit_to_char(r);
```
