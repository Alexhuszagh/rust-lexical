# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions 1.0+ are supported currently, and we do not support nor will make patches for those prior to 1.0. These under rare cases have unsound logic and therefore could be vulnerable.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |
