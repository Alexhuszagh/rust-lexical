# Licensing

Lexical is dual licensed under the Apache 2.0 license as well as the MIT
license. See the LICENCE-MIT and the LICENCE-APACHE files for the licenses.

Other licensing terms may apply, as described in depth below for various features and functionality. All assume use of `lexical` or `lexical-core`.

## `write-floats, not(compact)`

[lexical-write-float/src/algorithm.rs](/lexical-write-float/src/algorithm.rs) is a direct port of the reference C++ implementation of Dragonbox, found [here](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/).
This code (used if the `write-floats` feature is enabled and the `compact` feature is disabled) is subject to a [Boost Software License](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/blob/71993f55067a89f4b4e27591605e21521f5c61be/LICENSE-Boost) and a modified [Apache2 license](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/blob/71993f55067a89f4b4e27591605e21521f5c61be/LICENSE-Apache2-LLVM), shown in the [Boost Software License](#boost-software-license) and [Apache2 With LLVM Exceptions](#apache2-with-llvm-exceptions) sections below.

## `write-floats, compact`

[compact](/lexical-write-float/src/compact.rs) is a direct port of a C++ implementation of the Grisu algorithm, found [here](https://github.com/night-shift/fpconv/). This code (used if both the `write-floats` and `compact` features are enabled) is subject to a [MIT License](https://github.com/night-shift/fpconv/blob/dfeb7e938fb85fb5eca130b84f856705ced75012/license), shown in the [fpconv License](#fpconv-license) section below.

## `write-floats, radix`

[radix](/lexical-write-float/src/radix.rs) is adapted from the V8 implementation found [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/9ee58d91adc4f7d83882133941a3b7a2862059db/src/numbers/conversions.cc#L1232). This code (used if both the `parse-floats` and `radix` features are enabled) is subject to a [3-clause BSD license](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/f80bfeaf0792652bfbc1f174d5a7b8ab8bc0cbbd/LICENSE.v8), shown in the [V8 License](#v8-license) section below.

## `parse-floats, compact`

[bellerophon](/lexical-parse-float/src/bellerophon.rs) is loosely based off the Golang implementation, found [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b10849fbb97a2244c086991b4623ae9f32c212d0/src/strconv/extfloat.go). This code (used if both the `parse-floats` and `compact` features are enabled) is subject to a [3-clause BSD license](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b10849fbb97a2244c086991b4623ae9f32c212d0/LICENSE), shown in the [Go License](#go-license) section below.

## `i256`

[div](/lexical-util/src/math/div.rs) is modified from [arrow-rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/fcf4aa4cfb258903daab0029277ddfed1883bd90/arrow-buffer/src/lib.rs) This code (enabled only if `i256` is enabled) is subject to an [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/fcf4aa4cfb258903daab0029277ddfed1883bd90/LICENSE.txt).

“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,

##### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby

irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

##### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

##### 4. Redistribution

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

* **(a)** You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
this License; and
* **(b)** You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files; and

all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
Derivative Works; and
* **(d)** If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

##### 5. Submission of Contributions

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.

##### 6. Trademarks

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

##### 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
