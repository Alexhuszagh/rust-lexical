# Changelog

Notes significant changes to lexical-core.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2019-07-XX
### Changed
- Improved code generation and reduced binary bloat. There are a few algorithmic differences that make this possible, but the parsers now generally extract the float subcomponents first, then parsed known-good data after for enhanced performance.

### Removed
- Remove the unchecked parsers from the public API. `try_parse*` has been replaced with `parse*`.

## [0.4.3] - 2019-06-26
- Fixed a bug (issue #20) leading to incorrect float parsing (1 ULP error) for slow-path algorithms containing floats with a trailing 0-digit in the fraction component (discovery by @dangrabcad). Added in comprehensive unittests to avoid future regressions.
- Fixed CI for older Rustc versions due to issues with the `edition` keyword.
- Updated dependencies (credit to @junhoo).
- Updated the benchmarks for float and integer formatting to use `Write::write_fmt` rather than `to_string` to avoid heap allocation leading to misleading results (credit to @RazrFalcon).

## [0.4.2] - 2019-06-24
### Added
- Comprehensive continuous integration unittests for numerous platforms, based off the [trust](https://github.com/japaric/trust) templates.
- Added known issue for a non-default, lossy setting on armv6 architectures.

### Changed
- Bug fix for 32-bit targets.

## [0.4.1] - 2019-06-20
### Added
- Backwards compatible support for Rustc 1.24.0.

### Changed
- Worked around a bug in the internal float formatter where `&arr[idx]` creates a local copy in Rust versions before 1.28.0, creating a dangling reference after the scope ends. For more details, see `cached_grisu_power` in `/lexical-core/src/ftoa/grisu2.rs` .
