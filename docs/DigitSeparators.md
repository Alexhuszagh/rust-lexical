# Digit Separators

Supporting performant parsers using digit separators in a no-allocator context is difficult to support correctly with adequate performance. One of the major issues is that the syntax of numbers that accept digit separators varies between implementations.

For example, in Java literals, only internal (including consecutive) digit separators are allowed. Therefore, the following floats are considered valid or invalid:

```java
double x = 1.0_3_4_5;
double x = 1.0__3;
double x = 1.0__3e4_5;
double x = 1_.0;        // invalid
double x = 1._0;        // invalid
```

However, in Julia, internal (including consecutive) digit separators are only allowed in the significant digits of a number, and not the exponent. Therefore, the following floats are considered valid or invalid:

```java
double x = 1.0_3_4_5;
double x = 1.0__3;
double x = 1.0__3e4_5;  // invalid
double x = 1_.0;        // invalid
double x = 1._0;        // invalid
```

This means any parser must be context-aware, and also understand control characters: a digit separator followed by a decimal point is a trailing digit separator, while one followed by a digit is an internal one.

## Defining Grammar

Due to the context-aware nature, it's important to define the grammar on how digit separators work:

- Leading digit separators come before any other input, or after control characters. Any digit separators after a leading digit separator are considered leading, even if consecutive digit separators are not allowed.

Examples therefore include:

```ocaml
_1
__1
_1.0
__1.0
1._0
1.__0
1.0e_5
1.0e__5
```

- Trailing digit separators come after any other input, or before control characters. Any digit separators before another trailing digit separator are considered trailing, even if consecutive digit separators are not allowed.

Examples therefore include:

```ocaml
1_
1__
1_.0
1__.0
1.0_
1.0__
1.0e5_
1.0e5__
```

- Internal digit separators therefore are any digit separators that cannot be classified as leading or trailing. Likewise, any digit separators that are adjacent to another internal digit separator are considered internal, even if consecutive digit separators are not allowed.

Examples therefore include:

```ocaml
1_2
1__2
1_2.0
1__2.0
1.0_2
1.0__2
1.0e5_4
1.0e5__4
```

**Practical Definition**

This opens up a lot of possibilities: what is a valid control character? In practice, it's much easier to define control characters as every character that's not a valid digit, and therefore to handle parsing we just need to check against valid digits and the digit separator.

## Iterator Design

The iterator is therefore a generic based on the format specification: this allows the iterator to resolve all unnecessary branching at compile time.

The underlying iterator itself is very simple, and is effectively just:

```rust
pub struct Digits<'a> {
    slc: &'a [u8],
    index: usize,
}
```

The optimizing compiler translates this to very efficient machine code: it's as efficient as a normal slice iterator. However, it has a few advantages:

1. For partial parsers and error handling, the index is already known, and does not need to be derived from pointer comparisons.
2. It allows easy implementation of `peek`/`next` algorithms, since next is always `peek` and then increasing the `index` by 1.

Each digit separator iterator therefore is comprised of 4 different skip conditions, in addition to the skipped value:

1. \[L\], or leading digit separators.
2. \[I\], or internal digit separators.
3. \[T\], or trailing digit separators.
4. \[C\], or consecutive digit separators.

Therefore, `peek_iltc` means skip internal, leading, trailing, and consecutive digit separators. Different components of the number, such as the integral, fractional, and exponential digits may have different rules. To accommodate this, `Digits` is not technically an iterator, but rather contains `integer_iter`, `fraction_iter`, `exponent_iter`, and `special_iter`, to ensure the proper rules are followed and the correct branches are resolved at compile time.

Finally, if no digits are skipped for a given component, we can enable all the optimizations for no-skip iterators, including parsing multiple digits at a given time using fewer multiplication instructions.
